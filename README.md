# Unexpected Zero Handling in foo Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript where zero values are not handled correctly, resulting in unexpected function behavior.

The `foo` function is intended to add two numbers; however, it incorrectly returns 0 when either input is 0.

The solution shows the corrected function that handles zero values appropriately.  The bug and solution are demonstrated in the included javascript files.
